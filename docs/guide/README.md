# EchoFetch

EchoFetch is a decorator based HTTP client for browser & Node.JS based on Axios. It has been inspired by the Java library *RetroFit*.
EchoFetch will obtain the data from an API using a decorator based system.

You can find the full documentation here: [Documentation](https://maartenvn.github.io/EchoFetch/)

## How does it work

EchoFetch is a thin layer on top of [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), therefore allowing it to both run in the browser & in Node.JS.
It used the ES7 *Decorator-syntax* to create an implementation for a set of functions inside a class.
